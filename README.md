# hypercasualBallsGame
Unity replica of the already exiting game "Balls Master". This project is only supposed to be a showcase. It was made in 4 days using the Unity Engine, and only has 10 levels.

I developed all the mechanics by observing the original game "Balls Master" and trying to replicate it. For a faster level development  i designed an specific data type using scriptable objects, and also a custom inspector for faster editing.

The project is highly scalable. It's extremely easy to create and implement new block types and levels.
